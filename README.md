Basic Data Science (Technical) 

1. Python Programming Essentials 
We will start with a practical introduction to Python Programming Language. This includes installation and environment setup. You’ll learn the basic syntax and foundational concepts in python programming. We will cover expressions, functions, logic, conditionals, and modules. 

2. Libraries and Data Structures 
You’ll deepen your knowledge on python programming by learning the language’s data structures and some of the most common python packages used in data science such as numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn. 

3. Exploratory Data Analysis using Panda 
In this module, you will learn the most important data science toolkit in python for data preprocessing and manipulation — Pandas. You’ll learn how to clean, merge, process, and manipulate data in Series and DataFrame, the central data structures for data analysis. We’ll focus on statistical and descriptive analysis of data. 

4. Common Machine Learning Algorithms
You’ll learn the basics of some of the commonly used machine learning algorithms such as Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Networks. There will be practical hand ons in implementing these algorithms without explicitly programming them.
